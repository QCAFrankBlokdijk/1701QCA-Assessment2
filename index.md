## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###

Objects that enhance the users ability to remain focused.

### Design concept 1 ###

![Image](DC1.PNG)

My first design concept was an array of buttons that light up randomly, in the style of 'whack-a-mole' where the intent is to press them when they light up. The individual would have three misses, if they miss three lights then the vibration motors in the body would buzz, and the lights would flash red, indicating that the player has lost. Personally, I like this idea, as I'm a very visual person when it comes to design and in particular my design intent, however, the feasability of buying this many light up buttons means that I'm unable to do this project as it currently stands. 

Which brings us to:


### Design concept 2 ###

My second design concept is using the microbit 'halo', it's an iteration of the classic arcade game 'cyclone'. A single light spins around the centre at random speeds, and the objective is to catch the light as it goes past the button. Similar to the prior concept, the individual would have three misses, if they miss three lights then the vibration motors in the body would buzz, and the lights would flash red, indicating that the player has lost. I like this idea, however after speaking to David about it, we found a more interesting way to make this project come to life in terms of its interaction.

Which brings us to the final design concept:

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic.*

My final design concept is a different version of the classic cyclone machine, where now instead of trying to 'catch' the light with the button, the light will occasionally stop, and at this time the user will need to turn a dial to face the light. Same as the prior two designs, the individual would have three misses, if they miss three lights then the vibration motors in the body would buzz, and the lights would flash red, indicating that the player has lost.

The product will be made of wood, with a clear acrylic plate over the lights so the user can see them. My desk at home is made of wood, hence the use of wood in the creation of this product. I have a woodworking shed at my house, so the shell of the product will be made there.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
